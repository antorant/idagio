    <h1>IDAGIO / Browse (Web)</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>
    <p>The "Browse" screen was the second most-viewed screen in the web application, but had remained in MVP form — a static list of six composers and six performers — for a long time.</p>

    <h2>Goals:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Showcase the breadth and depth of the catalogue, and to illustrate IDAGIO's USP, the possibility to browse by classical-specific metadata.</li>
      <li>Create diverse entry points to the catalogue, and numerous ways to play music immediately.</li>
      <li>Educate newcomers by showing periods, epochs and genres in an intuitive and informative layout.</li>
      <li>Promote diversity: contemporary or lesser-known artists, non-white and non-male artists, more obscure instrumentation, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Constraints:</h2>
    <p>Design and development resources were focused on other company objectives, so we were unable to create new API endpoints or display content dynamically. The screen would have to remain static.</p>

    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <p>I mapped out a structure for the screen based on the core metadata aspects, then enlisted the content and editorial teams to create lists of artists and works according to their own criteria, based on their extensive knowledge and expertise. My screen designs were translated into code by the web engineers, and populated with the new content.</p>
