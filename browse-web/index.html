    <h1>IDAGIO / Browse (Web)</h1>

    <p class="large">I led an initiative to improve the Browse experience on the IDAGIO web product, working within tight constraints, by producing compelling prototypes and collaborating with our in-house classical music experts.</p>
    <img src="img/cover.png" />
    <p>The "Browse" screen was the second most-viewed screen in the web application, but had remained in MVP form — a short, static, hard-coded list of the most popular composers and performers — since the initial launch of the app.</p>
    <p><img src="img/before.png" /></p>
    <p>Our focus on growth meant that the deeper aspects of the product — aspects which embodied the real value of the platform — were rarely the focus of our efforts. There were often conversations about improving the Browse experience with contextual search or personalised recommendations, but these were always negated by a lack of back-end resources or the infeasibility of cross-platform feature development.</p>
    <p>I knew that we could make a significant improvement to the screen by exploring the problem while keeping the scope of the solution realistic, according to the technical constraints.</p>
    <p>Our two core user segments — classical music experts and non-experts — had different needs and expectations relating to the Browse experience. Experts wanted depth, diversity and expertise; non-experts needed orientation and easy entry points for exploration.</p>
    <p>I looked at each section of the screen through these two lenses, identifying changes we could make the experience better for both user segments.</p>
    <p><img src="img/matrix.png" /></p>

    <p>The solution:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a view for each of the existing sections</li>
      <li>Expand the lists of artists and compositions</li>
      <li>Restructure the lists to demonstrate the metadata structure.</li>
      <li>Include more direct links to music</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Composers</strong> view: show more famous composers as starting points for exploration, and more diverse and contemporary composers to demonstrate the depth of the catalogue.</p>
    <img src="img/01.png" />
    <p><strong>Performers</strong> view: show more household names as starting points for exploration, and expose the second layer of metadata to distinguish different types of performers.</p>
    <img src="img/02.png" />
    <p><strong>Periods</strong> view: show significant composers of each period on a timeline, demonstrating the metadata model and providing orientation.</p>
    <img src="img/03.png" />
    <img src="img/04.png" />
    <p><strong>Genres</strong> view: list important and interesting works, each linking to a popular recording. Provide a short explanation of the terminology.</p>
