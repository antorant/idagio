    <h1>IDAGIO / Browse (Web)</h1>

    <p class="large">I led an initiative to improve the neglected Browse experience on the IDAGIO web product, despite limited engineering resources, by producing compelling prototypes and collaborating with our in-house classical music experts.</p>
    <img src="img/cover.png" />
    <p>The "Browse" screen was the second most-viewed screen in the web application, but had remained in MVP form — a short, static, hard-coded list of the most popular composers and performers — since the initial launch of the app.</p>
    <p><img src="img/before.png" /></p>
    <p>Our focus on growth meant that the deeper aspects of the product — aspects which embodied the real value of the platform — were rarely the focus of our efforts. There were often conversations about improving the Browse experience with contextual search or personalised recommendations, but these were always negated by a lack of back-end resources or the infeasibility of cross-platform feature development.</p>
    <p>I knew that we could make a significant improvement to the screen by exploring the problem while keeping the scope of the solution realistic according to the technical constraints.</p>
    <p>Our two core user segments — classical music experts and non-experts — had different needs and expectations relating to the Browse experience. Experts wanted depth, diversity and expertise; non-experts needed orientation and easy entry points for exploration.</p>
    <p>I looked at each section of the screen through these two lenses, identifying changes we could make the experience better for both user segments.</p>

    <p>The essence of the changes were: expand the lists, restructuring them in some cases, and include more direct links to music.</p>
